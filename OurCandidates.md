## President, Orisa Coombs ##
<p align="justify"> As President of the Stanford Graduate Workers Union and member of the Stanford RED (Representation, Equity, and Diversity) slate, I will prioritize leveraging our collective power for robust contract enforcement and a powerful 2027 contract campaign. I was an active organizer from before our 2023 card-drop campaign and a member of the bargaining committee that won our first contract. I plan to build on these wins to create an even stronger union where every worker knows our rights. I believe that having a contract is not enough -- to see real change across our university we must stand together to enforce it. Under my leadership, the executive board will develop stewards across departments, empowering all workers to be organizers and ensuring everyone has a direct point of contact with the union. Furthermore, with mass participation, we will have the people power to fight and win grievance battles in the courtroom, setting powerful precedents and enshrining rights. Finally, I will set the stage for a stronger second contract with special attention to fellow inclusion, housing, external threats to our academic research funding, and other priorities of our worker body. </p>

## Vice President, Liam Sherman ##
<p align="justify"> Hey y’all, my name’s Liam and I’m a 2nd year PhD student in the Physics department. I started organizing with the union in late 2023, and have been organizing since then. During contract negotiations, I was one of the co-area chairs for sciences and worked with my fellow organizers to build an organizer network in the area. I’ve also been an active member of the Contract Action Team (CAT) for the past year. After the contract was ratified, I served on the constitutional committee to draft our union constitution. My time as area chair and on the constitution committee has given me a lot of experience with how the union operates, and what we could do to make it work even better in the future. As vice president, I would work to ensure we have a union that functions efficiently and democratically with input from all grad workers. As a new union with a new constitution, we have an opportunity to build infrastructure to ensure all grad workers benefit from the protections of our contract and that allows us to mobilize members to tackle any challenges that lie before us. I’m also running as a part of the Stanford Representation, Equity, and Democracy (RED) slate, which shares these goals and is made up of a lot of committed organizers who want to make the strongest union we can. </p>

## Treasurer, Ocean Zhou ##
<p align="justify"> Hi! I’m a 3rd year PhD candidate in the Applied Physics department. I’ve been heavily involved with our union since its inception in early 2023! Throughout our year-long contract fight in 2024, I took on extensive on-the-ground organizing duties, which involved consistently talking to countless graduate workers, answering questions, addressing concerns, and keeping people informed about the bargaining news. My work has strengthened my commitment to building a union that supports the rights and needs of every graduate worker. My substantial organizing experience has granted me deep insight into what matters most to graduate workers. As treasurer, I aim to draft a budget that addresses the most important concerns you all have and ensures you have the resources and support you deserve to prosper! I will be specifically running on the Stanford Representation, Equity, and Democracy (RED) slate. </p>

## Recording Secretary, Emi Soroka ##
<p align="justify"> I am a 4th year PhD in Electrical Engineering and have been involved in SGWU since organizers visited my office in 2022. Throughout our fight for a first contract, I assisted our Bargaining Committee in communicating their negotiation wins and encouraging grad workers to support their union via email and social media updates. Last year, I was also responsible for updating internal records to reflect TA positions and graduations. I'm interested in systems for large-scale organizing in our biggest Engineering departments.

As recording secretary, I want to continuously improve our processes for managing data of all kinds: from meeting minutes to email announcement archives, to the internal records that allow us to communicate with graduate workers across Stanford. If you've used https://sgwu.us/card  recently or made an access request to Slack, you’ve seen this work in action. I will be running on the Stanford Representation, Equity, and Democracy (RED) slate. Let's build our union together! </p>

## Campus Chief Steward, Helene Koumans ##
<p align="justify"> My name is Helene, and I am a first-year graduate worker in the department of chemistry. I am running for the position of Campus Chief Steward as part of the Representation, Equity, and Democracy (RED) slate. I got involved with our union the first week I arrived on campus and have had one-on-one conversations with graduate workers in dozens of departments about participating in our contract fight and membership drive. In order to ensure Stanford follows through on the wins of our contract and win a stronger second contract, our task is to build out our membership engagement and ensure the union is something everyone feels a part of. As Campus Chief Steward, my goal is to build a deep, well-organized steward network so that every graduate worker knows someone they can talk to about their protections and benefits at work. In just the first few months since we won our first contract, I have helped lead the effort to recruit stewards across dozens of departments. I am excited to build off of this foundation to set an expectation of robust contract enforcement through collective participation in all areas of the University.

We have a lot to fight for and a lot to win. </p>

## Area Chief Steward: Humanities, Mallen Clifton ##
<p align="justify"> My name is Mallen Clifton, and I am running for Humanities Chief Area Steward as part of the Representation, Equity, and Democracy (RED) slate. In this role, I will prioritize clear lines of communication, a strong sense of union community, and universal protections for all graduate workers. My experiences engaging with other workers have led me to these priorities: I am a 2nd year PhD student in English, where I’ve been serving as co-department lead since last summer. In that same time, I’ve been active in the Contract Action Team (CAT), and have engaged in considerable on-the-ground work. I developed a living document for the English department, which holds up-to-date and archived information from strike preparation to current contract enforcement. I have also helped run department town halls and union socials, and have been working in the Universal Protections Campaign, which aims to make sure our contract wins extend to everyone, including those that are only in the bargaining unit part-time. Building on these experiences, I hope to serve as Humanities Chief Area Steward to facilitate connection and community, and help provide a strong foundation for our union to come. </p>

## Area Chief Steward: MSCE, Chad Serrao ##
<p align="justify"> My name is Chad Serrao and I am a 3rd year PhD Candidate in Materials Science and Engineering. I am a big believer in people and optimistic about the prospect of working together to make something that can serve us all. I was an elected member of the committee responsible for drafting our union’s constitution and now I am running to serve student workers in the Chemical Engineering and Materials Science and Engineering Departments as the Chief Area Steward.<br>

When we won ourselves a union, we won ourselves the ability to have workplace democracy. Now is the time for us to build this together. As Chief Area Steward I want to work with my fellow graduate student workers to build-up the infrastructure required to have a robust and enduring democratic union that can understand and advocate for our needs as workers and as people.<br>

Towards this end, I would like to propose four objectives for this year as part of an effort to advocate and amplify. (1) Create weekly “Worker Office Hours” available for graduate workers in my area to meet one-on-one with myself and other union stewards to discuss what is on their mind. (2) Build a large network and a broad coalition with other graduate organizations on campus who share the goal of bettering the lives of graduate workers. (3) Work to build up the network of area stewards to do the necessary and important work required to understand and advocate for our common needs. (4) Protect all graduate student workers from the consequences of Federal funding cuts through full-enforcement of the contract that we won last year.<br>

In this election, I am running with the Stanford Representation, Equity, and Democracy (RED) slate on a shared vision and theory of action for our union. If what I have written here today has resonated with you, I encourage you to vote for me and for Stanford RED. I hope to be working with you soon to build our union together. </p>
