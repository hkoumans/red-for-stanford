# SGWU RED (Representation, Equity, and Democracy) Platform

### **Building Collective Power Through Mass Participation**
* Ramp up one-on-one conversations for deep organizing and to strengthen ties with other campus groups and sibling unions.
* Lay the groundwork for workers to be confident in taking large collective actions, up to and including a supermajority-participation strike if necessary to win our membership’s demands in 2027.
* Expand participation across all sections of Stanford grad workers to build engagement and a broad, inclusive steward network that can represent the diversity of our membership.

### **Worker Democracy**
* Build mass participation to empower every worker to have a voice in our union.
* Enable all workers to enforce our rights through the contract and our union’s tools. We want every worker to be able to discuss the issues they face with their coworkers and take action together for positive change.
* Deepen engagement in union democracy, through drop-in office hours, high attendance at general membership meetings, and surveys to elucidate worker priorities.
* Orient every incoming first-year graduate worker to the benefits and protections they hold as members of UE 1043.
* Actively engage graduate workers on fellowship in the fight for expanded rights and protections across Stanford.

### **Robust Contract Enforcement**
* Ensure every grad worker knows a steward and has a personal point of contact if they’re experiencing a problem on campus.
* Emphasize contract education outreach so workers understand and fully utilize their benefits. 
* Actively push back against Stanford’s contract interpretations which harm our workplace benefits and protections -- such as unjust discipline and 5-year guaranteed funding -- through organizing around common workplace grievances.
* Ensure that Stanford honors the 5-year funding guarantee we won in our contract fight and that no grad worker is let go in the face of federal research funding cuts – Stanford can afford to dip into its multi-billion dollar endowment

### **A Uniting and Powerful 2027 Contract Campaign**
* We won our first contract through mass collective participation, and we will likewise need to build the foundations now towards mass collective participation for our second contract.
* Address issues that are widely and deeply felt (e.g. high cost of living, international workers rights) in the next contract. Roll out a participatory bargaining survey to understand our membership’s contract priorities and invite them to participate in building the contract campaign.

### **We’re Part of a Movement for Changing Academia**
* Stand up against the assaults on higher education and the labor movement.
* Protect international scholar rights – our membership and the academic workforce come from locations all around the world and are part of a global research community, and we will not allow xenophobia to be used as a tool to divide us.
* Defend academic research and its funding in the face of federal attacks – grad workers do critical research that contributes to the public interest
* Strengthen and expand our connections with other campus organizations and unions across higher ed to weather political attacks on organized students and workers.
* Chart a vision for academia
