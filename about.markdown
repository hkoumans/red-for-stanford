# SGWU RED (Representation, Equity, and Democracy) Platform

### **Building Collective Power Through Mass Participation**
<p align="justify"> Mass collective participation is the source of our power and how we won our first contract, and what we win in bargaining is a reflection of that power. We will likewise need to build the foundations now towards mass collective participation to enforce our first contract and to win an even stronger second contract. In 2025, we aim to:
* Ramp up one-on-one conversations for deep organizing and to strengthen ties with other campus groups and sibling unions.
* Lay the groundwork for workers to be confident in taking large collective actions, up to and including a supermajority-participation strike if necessary to win our membership’s demands in 2027.
* Expand participation across all sections of Stanford grad workers to build engagement and a broad, inclusive steward network that can represent the diversity of our membership. </p>


### **Worker Democracy**
<p align="justify"> Stanford graduate workers run this union. Our members should be empowered to participate in the decisions that most impact them. We will:
* Build mass participation to empower every worker to have a voice in our union.
* Enable all workers to enforce our rights through the contract and our union’s tools. We want every worker to be able to discuss the issues they face with their coworkers and take action together for positive change.
* Deepen engagement in union democracy, through drop-in office hours, high attendance at general membership meetings, and surveys to elucidate worker priorities.
* Orient every incoming first-year graduate worker to the benefits and protections they hold as members of UE 1043.
* Actively engage graduate workers on fellowship in the fight for expanded rights and protections across Stanford. </p>


### **Robust Contract Enforcement**
<p align="justify"> We will need to protect the rights we won in our first contract, and the basis of strong contract enforcement is building strong mass participation. To that end, we will:
* Ensure every grad worker knows a steward and has a personal point of contact if they’re experiencing a problem on campus.
* Emphasize contract education outreach so workers understand and fully utilize their benefits. 
* Actively push back against Stanford’s contract interpretations which harm our workplace benefits and protections -- such as unjust discipline and worker inclusion in our bargaining unit -- through organizing around common workplace grievances.
* Ensure that Stanford honors the 5-year funding guarantee we won and that no grad worker is let go due to federal research funding cuts – Stanford can afford to dip into its multi-billion dollar endowment if necessary. </p>


### **A Uniting and Powerful 2027 Contract Campaign**
<p align="justify"> Our current contract expires in August 2027; to win big in 2027, SGWU-RED is committed to building mass participation at every level of our workplace so that every worker has greater control over their working and living conditions. Our priorities:
* Setting the groundwork for our next contract by building out our strike fund as well as strengthening and rolling out training for our steward network.
* Addressing issues that are widely and deeply felt, such as the high cost of living and rights and protections for international scholars, in the next contract.
* Building out our steward network so that by our next contract fight, we can ensure supermajority participation in a bargaining survey to help us understand our members' contract priorities and invite them to take an active role in building the contract campaign. </p>


### **We’re Part of a Movement for Changing Academia**
<p align="justify"> In the face of great uncertainty regarding the US political climate, we as workers at Stanford must have a voice at the table regarding our working and learning conditions. SGWU-RED will:
* Stand up together against the assaults on higher education and the labor movement as part of a movement of hundreds of thousands of unionized graduate workers across the country.
* Build off of the wins in our first contract to chart a vision for academia where robust workplace protections are a baseline expectation, burnout is not the norm, and graduate workers can focus on doing world-class research.
* Protect international scholar rights – our membership and the academic workforce come from locations all around the world and are part of a global research community, and we will not allow xenophobia to be used as a tool to divide us.
* Defend academic research and its funding in the face of federal attacks – graduate workers do world-class research that contributes to the public interest.
* Strengthen and expand our connections with other campus organizations and unions across higher ed to weather political attacks on organized students and workers. </p>
